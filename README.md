# About the game
This is a game about vikings rading and plundering, each other! It's a silly little sword and shield 3rd person slasher game. It was made as the fist of 12 games in a 12 month game making challenge. 

The game is made using Unreal Engine 4. 

# About the repo
This repository contains all you need to edit and build the game except 3rd party paid artefacts from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. Those are:

* Polygon Vikings Pack
* Ein Fantasy Viking
* Fast prototyping animation set
* Sword & Shield Anim Set Pro

The repository also exsludes the usual UE4 project aretefacts but those are not required to build the project.
